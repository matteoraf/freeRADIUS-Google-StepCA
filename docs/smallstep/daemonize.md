Running step as a daemon is a recommended approach for production environments.

Running in foreground is ok for testing and debugging, but once youâ€™re ready to deploy, you should really go the systemd way.

The guys at smallstep already explained everything [on the documentation](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/certificate-authority-server-production/#running-step-ca-as-a-daemon), I will just copy-paste everything here for convenience.

## Add a service user for the CA

```sh
{% raw %}
useradd --system --home /etc/step-ca --shell /bin/false step
{% endraw %}
```
## Give the step-ca binary low port-binding capabilities

```sh
{% raw %}
setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip $(which step-ca)
{% endraw %}
```
## Move your CA configuration into a system-wide location

```sh
{% raw %}
mv $(step path) /etc/step-ca
{% endraw %}
```
Make sure your CA password is located in _/etc/step-ca/password.txt_, so that it can be read upon server startup.

## Edit your config files to reflect the new steppath.

```sh
{% raw %}
sed -i "s|$(step path)|/etc/step-ca|g" /etc/step-ca/config/ca.json
sed -i "s|$(step path)|/etc/step-ca|g" /etc/step-ca/config/default.json
{% endraw %}
```
## Set the step user as the owner of your CA configuration directory:

```sh
{% raw %}
chown -R step:step /etc/step-ca
{% endraw %}
```
## Create a _/etc/systemd/system/step-ca.service_ unit file and add the content of [this](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/systemd/step-ca.service) file

## Enable and start the service

```sh
{% raw %}
# Rescan the systemd unit files
systemctl daemon-reload

# Check the current status of the step-ca service
systemctl status step-ca

# Enable and start the `step-ca` process
systemctl enable --now step-ca
{% endraw %}
```
