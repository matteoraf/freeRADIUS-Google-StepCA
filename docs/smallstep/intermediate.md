It’s now time to create our first intermediate CA.

We’ll use this CA to issue and sign certificates for servers (for example, the radius server).

I’d rather keep the SCEP provisioner on a separate CA, but you are of course free to put everything together.

So let’s spin up a new VM or whatever you prefer and start.
