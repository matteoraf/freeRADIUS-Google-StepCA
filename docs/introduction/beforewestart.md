# Before We Start

Just a couple of things to be aware of.

First of all, I’ve been using Debian to install and test all the stuff, so the commands you’ll see are all based on that. You’re free to use whatever OS you prefer, but you’ll need to adjust the command accordingly.

Second thing, many of the commands require root privileges on linux but you won’t find any sudo command in the document, that’s because to do these tests I’m spinning up debian containers to which I log in as root for my convenience, but if you encounter some failures, just be aware that you may require to use sudo.
